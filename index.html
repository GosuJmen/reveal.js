				<section>What are the differences between CI, CD, and CD?</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Continuous integration</h2>
					<p>
						Developers practicing continuous integration merge their changes back to the main branch as often as possible.
						The developer's changes are validated by creating a build and running automated tests against the build.
						By doing so, you avoid integration challenges that can happen when waiting for release day to merge
						changes into the release branch.
					</p>
					<p>
						Continuous integration puts a great emphasis on testing automation to check that the application
						is not broken whenever new commits are integrated into the main branch.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Continuous delivery</h2>
					<p>
						Continuous delivery is an extension of continuous integration since it automatically deploys all code changes to
						a testing and/or production environment after the build stage.
					</p> 
					<p>
						This means that on top of automated testing, you have an automated release process and you can deploy your
						application any time by clicking a button.
					</p>
					<p>
						In theory, with continuous delivery, you can decide to release daily, weekly, fortnightly, or whatever suits your
						business requirements. However, if you truly want to get the benefits of continuous delivery, you should deploy to
						production as early as possible to make sure that you release small batches that are easy to troubleshoot in case
						of a problem.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Continuous deployment</h2>
					<p>
						Continuous deployment goes one step further than continuous delivery. With this practice, every change that passes
						all stages of your production pipeline is released to your customers. There's no human intervention, and only a failed
						test will prevent a new change to be deployed to production.
					</p>
					<p>
						Continuous deployment is an excellent way to accelerate the feedback loop with your customers and take pressure off the
						team as there isn't a Release Day anymore. Developers can focus on building software, and they see their work go live
						minutes after they've finished working on it.
